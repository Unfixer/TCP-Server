This is how to make your own TCP Server in C
Hope this helps!
Socket files code will be provided soon
Read the comments carefully

USAGE:
1. Compile the server.c 
gcc server.c -o server
2. ./server
3. netstat -an | grep LISTEN
to see the servers it is listening to, check for your PORT (here 8181)
4. Try out 
env - telnet localhost 8181   // always make sure to use env because telnet has a tendency to send that extra data.
env just clears up the environment variable
5. Send some data, maybe pretend??
HEAD /HTTP/1.0  ....like this

All set.
